============
Native Sailfish OS application to control Jolla's WiFi using periodic check and location (if globally enabled) based rules. Its aim is to conserve battery and minimize data charges by turning WiFi off when not connected to a network, and turning it on when a known hotspot is present. It constantly learns where the hotspots are located to make its decisions.

*Automatically learns the WiFi hotspot locations.

*Uses the network location. No GPS battery drain.

*Allows to change the interval between hotspots checks.
